  "clubText": "Come to our club and you will never watch movies the same again! Go deeper into film ideas and think like a film critic...or just come and hang out! Film club is where students gather to watch movies from different eras and genres and discuss them in a relaxed, fun environment. While watching, we discuss all the interesting things the filmmakers were doing in creating the film. We want to know what the filmmaker wanted to tell the story in a specific way.  Films are selected regularly by students and range from blockbuster films to classics.  Films are all capped by a PG13 level rating.",
