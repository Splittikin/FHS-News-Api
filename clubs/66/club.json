Instead, members will play recreationally, with allergy-safe candy as a prize. In the first few meetings of the year, we will lead instructive games that will teach everyone the game, and then we will evolve into more of a competitive structure. The poker chips, playing cards, etc. will be supplied by the two presidents of the club.",
