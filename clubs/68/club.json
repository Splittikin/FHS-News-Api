  "clubText": "Fishers Dance Marathon is a student driven organization, focusing on yearlong fundraising that benefits Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. This organization was started in 2008, raising $6,400 to 2019, when we raised over $114,000. With all proceeds specifically going towards children's cancer research. The year culminates in a 6-hour dance marathon event, held in the CCA of Fishers High School. This is a magical, emotional and life-changing night for the student body, community and riley families. They get together to share stories, laughter and tears. Dances will be taught, awareness will be raised and the understanding of empathy and philanthropy will be present \"For The Kids\" at Riley Hospital.",
