We work together in groups to create presentations demonstrating traditional games, dances, and other aspects of a chosen country's culture. We also share what we learn about celebrations and enjoy food together. Our long-term goal is to host an international fair at Fishers High School and in the meantime we learn, share, and have fun. Students can join at anytime, even if you missed the call-out meeting!",
