  "clubText": "Model United Nations is an opportunity for students to apply their knowledge and skills in a real-world situation. Students learn and become \"delegates\" to various committees within the United Nations and then role-play through the procedures, debates, and negotiations that take place during UN meetings. During regular meetings and at optional competitions (both local and out-of-state), delegates work together to develop resolutions that solve a particular problem or provide new solutions to existing concerns. The skills necessary to do well in Model UN come from all disciplines, and no previous experience is required. Students share one common trait: they care and/or want to know more about the world around them. Want to know even more? See here. https://bestdelegate.com/what-is-model-united-nations/",
