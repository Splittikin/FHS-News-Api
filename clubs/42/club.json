  "clubText": "The Gardening Club aims to connect students with nature and the community through gardening. The Gardening Club will plant two seasons of plants (one in early fall and one in late spring), and what is grown will be donated to local charities or people in need. It mostly focuses on planting vegetables and fruits but could also branch out to plant other things like trees and bushes. The club will also work with the FHS Environmental Club on various activities, including planting trees, organizing a compost bin, making sure the garden uses environmentally-friendly fertilizer, etc. Overall, the Gardening Club accepts everyone who wants a closer relationship with nature and the community in an environmentally friendly way through gardening.
