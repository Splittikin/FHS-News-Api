  "clubText": "The club is to be considered a safe space for those who are North African or Middle Eastern (although this club is welcome to everyone!), because those from said origins tend to be confused sometimes. It is also meant to bring us together because being in a foreign country alone with few family & friends can be lonely. By bringing students together, the goal is to abate loneliness and homesickness. It is a great chance to meet each other and stand together.",
