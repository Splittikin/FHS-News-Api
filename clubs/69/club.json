  "clubText": "The robotics team competes in the FIRST Robotics League. The team works with mentors to design, build, and compete with a robot. The team mentors students for the following skills: mechanical building, electrical, marketing, computer programming, strategy, and leadership. The team meets two days per week during the non-competition season, and six days a week between January and April.  Many outreach events also occur throughout the year. Some of our practices will occur at Makers PlayGround in the Hub & Spoke building on 106th street.  A majority of our students receive college scholarships in a technical field.
